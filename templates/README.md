# iOS Module

This is an iOS module with 3 targets: the module itself, its tests, and a sample/demo application that uses the module.

## Requirements

1. [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)
2. Xcode

---

## Usage

### Install XcodeGen

The generated code uses XcodeGen in order to simplify managing xcode project configurations. If you don't already have XcodeGen installed in your machine, you will need it. One way to install it is by using homebrew:

`brew install xcodegen`

### Project Generation

- Generate the project by running `xcodegen generate`
- Open the generated file `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace`
